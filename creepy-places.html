	sacrificed themselves in the wars of independence. Legend says that a Lithuanian farmer<br>
	built a large wooden cross and placed it on the hill. The farmer had a daughter who was<br>

	by her spirit. Don Julian Santana Barrera was the caretaker of the island and found the<br>
	little girl. He saw a doll floating near the canal and figured it belonged to the girl and<br>
	as respect, he hung it to the tree. Julian was apparently haunted by the spirit of the<br>
	girl and started hanging more dolls in order to please her spirit. After collecting dolls<br>
	and hanging them for 50 years, he was found dead on the island at the exact spot where the<br>
	girl drowned. The dolls apparently move their hands and whisper to each other.</p>

	parents, Andrew Borden and Abby Borden with an ax. Investigations found a hatchet with a<br>
	broken handle in the cellar of the home. Lizzie was charged with murder of her father and<br>
	stepmother however there was no conclusive proof that the hatchet was the murder weapon.<br>
	Also the burning of Lizzie’s dress that may or may not have been worn on the day of the<br>
	murders wasn’t enough to convince the jury. Till this day, the Borden murders remains<br>
	unsolved. The house has been turned into a bed and breakfast for tourist.</p>
