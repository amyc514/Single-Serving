	girl and started hanging more dolls in order to please her spirit. After collecting dolls

	broken handle in the cellar of the home. Lizzie was charged with murder of her father and
	stepmother however there was no conclusive proof that the hatchet was the murder weapon.
	Also the burning of Lizzie’s dress that may or may not have been worn on the day of the
	murders wasn’t enough to convince the jury. Till this day, the Borden murders remains
	unsolved. The house has been turned into a bed and breakfast for tourist.</p>
